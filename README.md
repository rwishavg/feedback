## Team 11 - Feedback App

-----------------------------------

### Project Overview
----------------------------------

#### The Problem

In a nutshell, the gist of the problem was to develop a product that would help track how well a teacher does his or her work according to the students they're teaching, tracked by an individual that has mutual authority over both the parties (in our case, the Class Teacher).

Breaking this down on the basis of production, we obtain the following sub-problems:
- A frontend that can provide easy addition of both teachers and students.
- A backend that can manage a query ready dataset to support the above.

#### The Solution

The proposed solution goes as follows:

#### Technical Description

Documented below are the attributes of the product from a technical standpoint.

##### Technologies

The technologies used by our team in the production of our solution are listed as follows:
- Visual Studio Code - [[v1.42](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
- Git SCM - [[v2.25.0](https://git-scm.com/)]
- Android Studio - [[3.5](https://developer.android.com/studio)]
  - Gradle - [[4.10](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/)]
- Firebase Cloud - [[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/)]
- Discord [[Stable](https://discordapp.com/)]
- Non Functional Ion Routers

##### Installation

The product is deployed as a signed *Android Application Package* (APK) which can be easily installed on supported Android devices (Nougat and above).

##### Self Testing the Submitted Code

To test the provided source package on another machine, assuming it has most of the technologies listed above, one must first clone the project's [Git repository](https://github.com/rwishavg/feedback) onto a clean local folder. This downloads an Android Studio Project (under the */Application Code* directory) which must then be opened with the corresponding software.

Then, the project can simply be built, modified, or deployed as seen fit.
